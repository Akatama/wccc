# wccc - wc Coding Challenges

This is a small project I did to learn a bit about C.

The instructions are here: https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-wc/

I had some trouble with some parts of this, specifically dealing with the wide characters and dealing with stdin. I ended up finding this project on github that helped me complete it: https://github.com/shellmonk/mccwc/blob/main/mccwc.c

I had done a good part of this on my own, but since I was doing this for learning, I thought about how I did some things, and how shellmonk had done some things. In the end, I took a lot of their design. This was for me to learn though, so if anything it is good that I was able to take my original design, compare it to someone more experienced than me and see what was better about theirs.
